Customer Churn Prediction
Description: Predict whether a customer will leave a service (e.g., telecom, SaaS, banking) using historical data.

Process:
	1.	Collect dataset (e.g., Kaggle: Customer Churn Dataset).
	2.	Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) using Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn.
	3.	Build classification models (Random Forest, XGBoost) using scikit-learn.
	4.	Deploy the model as an API using FastAPI + Docker.
	5.	Host the API on Azure App Service.   

Tech Purpose:
	•	Azure App Service → Deploy API in the cloud.
	•	Docker → Containerize the API for portability.
